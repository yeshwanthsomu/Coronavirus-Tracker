# Coronavirus-Tracker

Welcome to the Coronavirus Tracker. 

This R Code will show you three components, Daily Confirmed Cases in Top Countries, Daily Confirmed Cases in States, and Chance of Infection in States.

The DailyCases.Rmd file shows the source code for all the analysis/cleaning and coding done for the visualization. 

The DailyCases.htm is the webpage where the visualization lives, but will only open the source code for the website.

Please visit the website for looking at the visualization!
